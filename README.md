This uses the Tweepy API, which can be found [here](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.5.0/api.html).

Before Getting Any Friends and Followers
=
1.) Setup tweepy by navigating to **tweepy** and running the command `python setup.py`.

2.) Get a Twitter API key [here](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new).  Fill in **twitter_scripts/config/twitter_config.txt** with the access keys/tokens/secrets.  Twitter rate limits each key separately, so you can generate multiple access keys and save them in multiple .txt files if you want do multiple things at once.

3.) Put a .csv file with two columns, Twitter screen name and Twitter user id (in that order) in the **twitter_scripts_/data/** directory.  Name the spreadsheet **usernames.csv**.

4.) In the terminal window, navigate to the **twitter_scripts** directory and run the command `python csv_to_json.py`.  This will reformat the .csv file as a .json file.

5.) Run the command `python get_user_data.py config/twitter_config.txt`.  This will pull data about each user on the spreadsheet from Twitter.

Follower and Following Relations
=
- To get follower relations: run the command `python get_followers.py config/twitter_config.txt`.  This will output **data/username_to_follower_id.json** which maps a screen name to a list of follower ids.  The updates printed to the console don't seem to be completely correct, but I haven't had time to fix that.
- To get friend relations: run the command `python get_friends.py config/twitter_config.txt`.  This will output **data/username_to_friend_id.json** in the which maps a screen name to a list of friend ids.
- To reformat these as spreadsheets, run the commands `python json_to_csv.py data/username_to_follower_id.json` and `python json_to_csv.py data/username_to_friend_id.json`.  This will output **data/username_to_follower_id.csv** and **data/username_to_friend_id.csv**.
- These can take a really long time because of rate limiting.

Union and Intersection of Friends and Followers
=
Run the command `python make_union_and_intersection_weights.py`.  This will output three .csv files of the form **screen name 1, screen name 2, |intersection|, |union|,|intersection|/|union|**.
- **data/weights_followers.csv**: shared followers
- **data/weights_friends.csv**: shared friends
- **data/weights.csv**: shared friends and followers

Getting Retweets
=
Given a .csv file with a list of tweet ids, this script gets the retweet count for each tweet.  If the tweet data cannot be found, the cell in the retweets column will be empty.  Duplicate tweet ids will be removed from the output spreadsheet.  To get rewteet counts, run the command `python get_retweets_by_tweet_ids.py data/input.csv config/tweetids.txt`, where **tweetids.csv** is the a .csv spreadsheet with tweet ids in the first column.  The output will be a .csv file **data/tweetids_retweets.csv**.  You don't need to set up tweepy or run any other scripts before running this script, but you do need a Twitter API key as described in step 2 above.
